1. **Presentation Layer:** HTML/CSS provides the static structure and visual styling.
2. **Application Layer:** Centralized state (AppState) and core business logic.
3. **Compilation Simulation Layer:** Lexer, Parser, and Interpreter modules simulate compilation.
4. **Visualization Layer:** Dynamic rendering of simulation state (memory, tokens, AST).
5. **Event Handling Layer:** User interaction processing and control flow management.

### Module Decomposition and Responsibilities
- **index.html:**  
  - Sets up the document structure and dynamic placeholders.
- **styles.css:**  
  - Provides comprehensive styling and responsive design.
- **main.js:**  
  - Bootstraps the application, initializes AppState, and coordinates module interactions.
- **ui-components.js:**  
  - Creates and configures UI elements; manages educational modals.
- **state.js:**  
  - Houses the AppState and data model definitions (Token, ASTNode, ExecutionStep, StackFrame, HeapBlock).
- **lexer.js:**  
  - Processes raw C code into a token stream.
- **parser.js:**  
  - Uses recursive descent parsing to build an AST from tokens.
- **interpreter.js:**  
  - Simulates runtime execution by generating detailed execution steps.
- **visualization.js:**  
  - Renders runtime state visually and updates the UI accordingly.

#### Control Flow (Sequence Diagram)
1. **Startup Sequence:**  
   - Browser loads `index.html` and `styles.css`.
   - `main.js` waits for DOMContentLoaded.
   - AppState is instantiated; `loadExamples()` is invoked.
   - UI components are initialized by `ui-components.js`.
   - Event handlers are bound in `event-handlers.js`.
2. **Code Execution Sequence:**  
   - User selects or enters code and clicks “Run.”
   - `executeCode(appState)` is invoked:
     - Source code is stored in AppState.
     - `lexer.js.tokenize()` generates a token stream.
     - `parser.js.parse()` constructs the AST.
     - `interpreter.js.generateExecutionSteps()` produces execution steps.

      "output": "x = 10\n"
    }
  }
  ```

---

### 4.3 Compiler Simulation Components

#### Lexical Analysis (lexer.js)
- **Algorithm:**
    - Iterates over each character in the source code.
    - Uses a set of regular expressions for different token types:
        - Keywords (e.g., `/\b(int|char|if|else)\b/`).
        - Operators (e.g., `/\+\+|--|\+|-|\*|\/|==|!=/`).
        - Preprocessor directives (e.g., `/^#(include|define|ifdef)/`).
    - Maps newline indices to compute accurate line/column positions.
- **Error Handling:**
    - If an unrecognized sequence is encountered, logs an error with position.
    - Fallback to a “generic token” if possible to allow parsing to continue.
- **Extensibility:**
    - Designed with a modular configuration so new token types can be added by updating the definitions object.
- **Performance:**
    - Optimized with loop unrolling and precompiled regular expressions.

#### Syntax Analysis and AST Generation (parser.js)
- **Parsing Strategy:**
    - Implements recursive descent parsing.
    - Uses lookahead to decide between declarations and function definitions.
    - Each parsing function (e.g., `parseTypeDeclaration`, `parseCompoundStatement`) is documented with preconditions and postconditions.
- **Error Reporting:**
    - If `consume()` fails, throws an error with the expected token type/value and current token position.
    - Includes recovery strategies (e.g., skipping tokens until a semicolon) for non-critical errors.
- **AST Construction:**
    - Each node is instantiated as an ASTNode with type-specific metadata.
    - Supports annotations for later visualization (e.g., node IDs, parent-child relationships).
- **Algorithmic Complexity:**
    - Analyzed for worst-case O(n) where n is the number of tokens.
    - Provides benchmarks and logging for performance monitoring.

#### Execution Simulation (interpreter.js)
- **Simulation Engine:**
    - Analyzes the AST and determines the control flow.
    - Generates an array of ExecutionStep objects.
    - Detailed subroutines simulate:
        - Variable assignments and updates.
        - Pointer operations and memory address calculations.
        - Function calls (push/pop of StackFrame objects).
        - Dynamic memory allocation (HeapBlock creation and deallocation).
    - Each step records a complete snapshot of changes.
- **Logging and Audit:**
    - Every simulated operation logs detailed context (operation type, source line, state changes).
    - Supports exporting logs as JSON for ISO audits.
- **Error Handling:**
    - Catches runtime anomalies (e.g., null pointer references) and converts them into warning steps.
    - Implements fallback simulation paths to maintain interactivity.
- **Performance Considerations:**
    - Predefines base addresses (e.g., 0x1000 for stack, 0x8000 for heap) to speed up lookup.
    - Uses caching mechanisms for repeated expressions.

---

### 4.4 Visualization and Rendering

#### Visualization Module (visualization.js)
- **Core Functionality:**
    - `updateVisualizations()`: Reads AppState.currentStep and calls sub-functions.
    - **Memory Visualization:**
        - `updateMemoryVisualization(step)`:
            - Clears and rebuilds memory display.
            - Groups memory addresses into “Stack Memory” (addresses < 0x8000) and “Heap Memory” (addresses ≥ 0x8000).
            - Offers a toggle between a summary view and a detailed byte-level view.
            - Animates changes (using CSS transitions) to highlight updated cells.
    - **Stack Visualization:**
        - `updateStackVisualization(step)`:
            - Iterates over AppState.stack.
            - Highlights the active frame (most recent call).
            - Displays variable names, values, and addresses.
    - **Token and AST Highlighting:**
        - Uses callbacks from ASTNode traversal to highlight corresponding lines in the code editor.
        - Synchronizes token list with current execution context.
    - **Console Output:**
        - `updateConsoleOutput(step)`:
            - Appends new output to a scrolling console pane.
            - Maintains a history of output with timestamped entries.
- **Accessibility and Responsiveness:**
    - Implements ARIA live regions to announce updates to screen readers.
    - Uses media queries to adjust layout for mobile and desktop.
- **Performance:**
    - Minimizes reflows by updating only changed DOM elements.
    - Batches DOM manipulations to avoid excessive repaint cycles.

---

### 4.5 Event Handling and Control

#### Event Handlers (event-handlers.js)
- **Core Responsibilities:**
    - `setupEventHandlers(appState)`:
        - Binds events to the code editor, example selector, navigation buttons, play/pause control, speed slider, and interactive input.
    - **Execution Trigger:**
        - `executeCode(appState)`:
            - On “Run” button click, updates AppState.code.
            - Calls Lexer.tokenize(), Parser.parse(), and Interpreter.generateExecutionSteps() sequentially.
            - Handles errors and displays them using `showError()`.
    - **Navigation Functions:**
        - Implements `goToFirstStep()`, `goToPreviousStep()`, `goToNextStep()`, and `goToLastStep()`:
            - Updates AppState.currentStep.
            - Triggers Visualizer.updateVisualizations().
    - **Auto-Execution Control:**
        - Implements a timer for play/pause functionality.
        - Reads value from speed slider to adjust interval.
    - **Interactive Input Processing:**
        - Evaluates user input, generates new execution steps, and refreshes visualizations.
- **Error Handling and Fallbacks:**
    - Wraps all event handler functions with try-catch blocks.
    - Uses a centralized `showError(message)` function to display modal dialogs.
- **Optimizations:**
    - Employs event delegation to minimize listener overhead.
    - Uses throttling for input events to prevent flooding.

---

### 4.6 Main Integration and Bootstrapping

#### main.js
- **Initialization Sequence:**
    - Waits for `DOMContentLoaded` before execution.
    - Instantiates a global AppState object.
    - Calls `loadExamples(appState)` from interpreter.js to populate preloaded code.
    - Invokes `initializeUI(appState)` to bind all UI components.
    - Sets up event handlers via `setupEventHandlers(appState)`.
    - Optionally loads a default example (e.g., “basic”) for immediate demonstration.
- **Error Handling:**
    - Wraps initialization in a try-catch; if an error occurs, replaces page content with a friendly error message.
- **Logging:**
    - Outputs detailed initialization logs (e.g., “IFSCee initialized successfully”) to the console for audit purposes.

---

## 5. Error Handling, Logging, and Security

### Error Detection and Reporting
- **Lexical/Parsing Errors:**
    - Errors are thrown with detailed context (expected vs. actual token, line, column).
    - Uses a standardized error format to support ISO audits.
- **Runtime Simulation Errors:**
    - Runtime errors (e.g., pointer dereference errors) are captured and converted into ExecutionStep warnings.
    - Errors are aggregated in AppState for later export.
- **UI Event Errors:**
    - Caught by event-handlers; reported via modal dialogs with user-friendly messages.

### Logging Mechanisms and Audit Trails
- **Console Logging:**
    - Every critical operation is logged using `console.log`, including timestamps.
- **State Logging:**
    - `AppState.logState()` provides a full snapshot (serialized as JSON) for audit purposes.
- **Persistent Logging:**
    - Optionally, logs can be exported to a file for offline ISO/MPS-BR/CMMI audit reviews.
- **Compliance:**
    - Logging complies with ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 12207 requirements for audit trails.

### Security Considerations and Input Sanitization
- **User Input:**
    - All input from the editor and interactive fields is sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and injection attacks.
- **Code Evaluation:**
    - Uses a sandboxed function evaluation for interactive inputs.
- **Data Privacy:**
    - No sensitive data is sent externally; all processing is client-side.
- **Standards Compliance:**
    - Adheres to ISO/IEC 27001 best practices and incorporates secure coding guidelines.
